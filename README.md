# momo 魔改
- 安装sdk `sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://sdk.dfinity.org/install.sh)"`
- 安装依赖 `npm install` or `yarn install`
- dfx start --background (本地把环境跑起来)
- dfx deploy （部署，包含前端代码的编译）
- 手动修改一下 `dist/contacts_assets/index.js`，把 `const contacts = createActor(canisterId)` 这段代码改为
```javascript
// 配置host：http://localhost:8000，访问本地环境
const contacts = createActor(canisterId, {
    agentOptions: {
        host: 'http://localhost:8000',
    }
});
```
- dist/contacts 目录可直接作为chrome扩展加载
- 打开扩展查看页面： 1. 录入信息并点击 【Add Contact】保存； 2. 输入name 点击【Lookup】将信息取回并显示; 3. 示例页面没有交互优化，可以录入两个或多个用户的信息，再来回切换用户【Lookup】，这样可以更好的看到之前录入的信息被取回，页面有更直观的变化

# contacts

Welcome to your new contacts project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with contacts, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd contacts/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
